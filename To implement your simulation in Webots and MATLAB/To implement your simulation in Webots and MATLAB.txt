To implement your simulation in Webots and MATLAB, follow these steps:

Webots Implementation
Install Webots: Download and install Webots from the official website.
Create a New Project: Open Webots and create a new project directory.
Set Up the Environment:
Create a new world file (.wbt) and set up the environment (e.g., terrain, obstacles).
Add UAV robots to the world. You can use predefined UAV models or create custom ones.
Program the UAVs:
Write controller scripts for the UAVs in Python or C++.
Implement the logic for detection, response, and coverage efficiency.
Run the Simulation:
Use Webots' simulation tools to run and visualize the UAVs' behavior.
Collect data on detection times, accuracies, coverage efficiencies, and response times.
MATLAB Implementation
Install MATLAB: Ensure you have MATLAB installed with necessary toolboxes (e.g., Robotics System Toolbox).
Set Up the Simulation:
Create scripts or functions to simulate UAV behavior.
Define parameters for detection times, accuracies, coverage efficiencies, and response times.
Data Analysis and Visualization:
Use MATLAB's plotting functions to visualize the results.
Implement the plot_results function to generate plots similar to your Python code.
Detailed Steps
Webots
Install Webots:

Download from Webots.
Follow installation instructions for your OS.
Create a New Project:

Open Webots.
Create a new project directory.
Set Up the Environment:

Create a new world file (.wbt).
Add terrain and obstacles.
Add UAV robots (e.g., e-puck, drone).
Program the UAVs:

Create controller scripts (e.g., uav_controller.py).
Implement detection, response, and coverage logic.
Run the Simulation:

Use Webots' simulation tools.
Collect and log data.
MATLAB
Install MATLAB:

Define parameters and logic.
Data Analysis and Visualization:

Implement plot_results function.
Use plot, scatter, etc., for visualization.


Example MATLAB Code

function plot_results(detection_times, accuracies, coverage_efficiencies, response_times, scalability_data)
    figure;
    subplot(2,2,1);
    plot(detection_times, accuracies, '-o');
    title('Detection Times vs Accuracies');
    xlabel('Detection Times');
    ylabel('Accuracies');

    subplot(2,2,2);
    plot(detection_times, coverage_efficiencies, '-o');
    title('Detection Times vs Coverage Efficiencies');
    xlabel('Detection Times');
    ylabel('Coverage Efficiencies');

    subplot(2,2,3);
    plot(detection_times, response_times, '-o');
    title('Detection Times vs Response Times');
    xlabel('Detection Times');
    ylabel('Response Times');

    subplot(2,2,4);
    plot(scalability_data.num_uavs, scalability_data.avg_detection_times, '-o');
    hold on;
    plot(scalability_data.num_uavs, scalability_data.avg_response_times, '-o');
    title('Scalability Data');
    xlabel('Number of UAVs');
    ylabel('Times');
    legend('Avg Detection Times', 'Avg Response Times');
    hold off;
end

% Example usage
detection_times = [5, 4, 3, 2];
accuracies = [90, 92, 93, 95];
coverage_efficiencies = [80, 85, 90, 95];
response_times = [3, 2.5, 2, 1.5];
scalability_data.num_uavs = [5, 10, 15, 20];
scalability_data.avg_detection_times = [5, 4, 3, 2];
scalability_data.avg_response_times = [3, 2.5, 2, 1.5];

plot_results(detection_times, accuracies, coverage_efficiencies, response_times, scalability_data);






Conclusion
By following these steps, you can implement and simulate your UAV research in both Webots and MATLAB, allowing for comprehensive analysis and visualization of your results.
